This config folder is for bootstrapping the set up of software at DAB.

Make sure it has these files and directories inside:
bin
mayaAppDir
sourceMe
terminal

You should launch maya from the terminal:
1. double click on terminal in your new home area and you get a shell
2. use cd to change to the new home directory (can drag from finder to terminal)
3. make sure you are at the level where you can see the file sourceMe - use ls to list the files where you are and cd to move about ( cd ..    moves up  one level )
4. type source sourceMe in the terminal, should set env var $CONFIG, and tell you whats happened.
5. can type 'maya' in the shell as it is now in your path
6. dont close the terminal - you can launch and relaunch maya from here over again as you need to.  Maya will give you feedback to this terminal.
